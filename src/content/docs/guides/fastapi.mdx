title: On Python for HTTP APIs
description: A list of personal preferences and best practices when writing an HTTP API with Python.
---

Nowadays, writing an HTTP API is a common task for many developers. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for
building _typesafe_ APIs with Python. It is easy to use and has great documentation.

This guide intends to list our personal preferences and best practices when writing an HTTP API with FastAPI. It is not a comprehensive guide to FastAPI, but rather
a collection of tips and tricks that we have found useful in our own projects.

# Project setup

Usually, we start a new project using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package installer and resolver:

```bash
uv init myapp
```

and add dependencies to it as needed. For example, to add FastAPI and a few other dependencies, we can run:

```bash
uv add fastapi --extra standard
```

## Environment variables

Since FastAPI integrates with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for data validation, we can use `pydantic-settings` to manage environment variables.
This library allows us to define settings classes that can load environment variables from `.env` files or the system environment, and even docker secrets, automatically.

A simple example of a settings class would be:

```python
# config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")
    secret_key: str = "supersecret"


config = Settings()
```

:::note
Usually, when using `.env` files you should not commit them to version control. You can use `.env.example` files to document the expected environment variables.

# Typesafe Routes

The main feature of FastAPI is its ability to generate typesafe routes. This means that we can define our routes using Python type hints along with Pydantic models,
and FastAPI will automatically validate the request and response data for us. This is a powerful feature that can help us catch errors early in the development process.
It also makes our code more readable and maintainable, and automatically generates OpenAPI documentation for our API.

The simplest example of a route would be:

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Hero(BaseModel):
    name: str
    secret_name: str
    age: int

@app.post("/heroes")
async def create_hero(hero: Hero) -> Hero:
    return hero
```

# Data fetching

It is common to fetch data from a database or an external API in our routes.

## Database

When fetching data from a database, we can use an ORM like [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) or [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/).

These libraries integrate well with FastAPI and allow us to define our database models using Python classes and Pydantic models. This makes it easy to validate the data
we receive from the database and return it in a typesafe way.

Here is an example with SQLModel:

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select


class Hero(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str = Field(index=True)
    secret_name: str
    age: int | None = Field(default=None, index=True)


sqlite_file_name = "database.db"
sqlite_url = f"sqlite:///{sqlite_file_name}"

connect_args = {"check_same_thread": False}
engine = create_engine(sqlite_url, echo=True, connect_args=connect_args)

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/heroes")
def create_hero(hero: Hero) -> Hero:
    with Session(engine) as session:
        session.add(hero)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(hero)
        return hero
```

## External API

When fetching data from an external API, we can use the [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) library. This library is a modern HTTP client for Python that supports
async requests and is compatible with FastAPI. It also has a built-in JSON decoder that can automatically decode JSON responses into Pydantic models.
This makes it easy to validate the data we receive from the external API and return it in a typesafe way.

Here is an example of how to use httpx to fetch data from an external API:

```python
# app.py
import httpx
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Hero(BaseModel):
    name: str
    secret_name: str
    age: int

@app.post("/heroes")
async def create_hero(hero: Hero) -> Hero:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post("https://api.example.com/heroes", data=hero.dict())
        data = response.json()

    return Hero(**data)
```

# Extra considerations

For a production-ready API, we should consider a few extra things:

## CORS

If you want the API to accessible from other domains, you need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). FastAPI has built-in support for CORS using the
`fastapi.middleware.cors` module.

## Caching and Rate limiting

When building an API, it is important to consider caching and rate limiting. Caching can help improve the performance of your API by reducing the number of requests
to the database or external API and reduce sensitive server load. Rate limiting can help prevent abuse of your API by limiting the number of requests that can be made
in a given time period. You can use [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching and rate limiting.

## Authentication and Authorization

FastAPI has built-in support for authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and JWT tokens. You can use the `fastapi.security` module to implement authentication
and authorization in your API, but if you want to integrate with an existing authentication system, you can use [Authlib](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/).

## Deployment

You should consider not deploy your API on "bare-metal" servers. Instead, you should use a containerization tool like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to package your
API and its dependencies into a single container.

This makes it easy to deploy your API on any platform that supports Docker, and also makes it easy to scale your API by running multiple containers.

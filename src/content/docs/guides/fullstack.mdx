description: A list of personal preferences and best practices when writing a web application.
---

The web is a powerful platform for building applications. It allows us to create rich, interactive experiences that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
However, building a web application can be a complex task, and there are many different technologies and frameworks to choose from, specially nowadays with the rise of
so many JavaScript frameworks.

This guide intends to list our personal preferences and best practices when writing a web application. It is not a comprehensive guide to web development, but rather
a collection of tips and tricks that we have found useful in our own projects.

## Backend and Frontend: two runtimes, one app

When your web application is not only defined by the code running in the browser, but also by data and logic running on a server it can be defined as a "fullstack"
application. There are many different ways to build a fullstack application, but the most convenient way is to use a single language and technology stack for both the
backend and the frontend, as this allows us to communicate efficiently between the two runtimes and share code between them.

Since the web runs JavaScript in the browser, someone (Ryan Dahl) had the brilliant idea of running JavaScript on the server too, and thus Node.js was born.
This allowed us to build fullstack applications using a single language, JavaScript.

Considering that React is the most popular frontend framework, and that Node.js is the most popular backend runtime, it is no surprise that the most popular fullstack
framework is Next.js. It allows us to build fullstack applications using React and Node.js, and it has a great developer experience.

Modern React is also made for running in the backend, see [React for Two Computers](https://overreacted.io/react-for-two-computers/).

## Dependency management

_Before_ we jump into Next.js, we need to talk about how do we get it into our project. Next.js is a JavaScript package, and like so, it needs to be installed. There are many different ways to add dependencies in a JavaScript project, but the most popular ones are npm, yarn and pnpm.

A package manager is a tool that allows us to install, update and remove packages in our project. In a fullstack application, this choice is especially important, as we will be managing a lot of packages for both the backend and the frontend, and we need to make sure that our package manager is fast and efficient.

In our experience, of the three mentioned above, we found that pnpm is the best package manager for its speed and developer experience. It is also the most popular package manager for monorepos, which is a common pattern in fullstack applications.

:::note[Why pnpm?]
pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager. It uses hard links and symlinks to save disk space and speed up installations. If you want to learn more about pnpm, you can check out the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/).
:::

:::caution[Why not npm?]
npm is the default package manager for Node.js, but it has some performance issues that can make it slow and inefficient. It also has a lot of legacy code that can cause problems in modern applications. If you want to learn more about npm, you can check out the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

### Honorable mentions

Recently, Node.js is not the only way to run JavaScript on the server. There are many other runtimes that allow us to run JavaScript on the server, such as Deno and Bun. Particularly those two, are pushing forward the JavaScript ecosystem and are capabilities for better security, performance and developer experience. Both of them come with their own package manager, with standard libraries and a lot of other features that make them great alternatives to Node.js.

## The framework

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a fullstack framework for building web applications using React and Node.js. It is a very popular framework for building fullstack applications with great developer experience, documentation and community support. It is also the first recommended framework for building React applications [by the React team](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app). It comes with a lot of features and tooling that make it easy to build modern web applications in React, such as routing, server-side rendering, data fetching and optimization, with features like hot reloading, TypeScript support and a powerful CLI.

:::note[React]
[React](https://react.dev/) is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web. It is a declarative, component-based library that allows us to build complex user interfaces using simple, reusable components.
:::

To start a new Next.js application, we can use the `create-next-app` command, which is a CLI tool that allows us to create a new Next.js application with a single command. It will create a new directory with all the necessary files and dependencies to get started with our application.

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-next-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies to get started with our application. It will also install all the dependencies using pnpm, so we can start developing our application right away.

## More layers to the cake

Next.js is a great framework for building fullstack applications with a lot of batteries included, but we usually need to pick some extra layers to our stack depending on the needs of our application. In our common use cases, we usually end up needing the following extra layers:

- **tRPC**: [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is a library for building _type-safe_ APIs using TypeScript. It is a great alternative to REST and GraphQL, as it allows us to build APIs that are easy to use and understand, with great developer experience and type safety.

- **Tanstack Query**: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) is a library for managing server state in React applications. It is a great alternative to traditional state management libraries, as it allows us to manage server state in a simple and efficient way, with great developer experience and performance.

- **Tailwind CSS**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build modern user interfaces using simple, reusable classes directly in our HTML.
  It is a great alternative to traditional CSS frameworks, as it allows us to build responsive and modern user interfaces without writing a lot of custom CSS.

- **shadcn/ui**: shadcn/ui is not exactly a installable library, but a collection of reusable components built using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI that you can directly copy and paste into your project or use the [CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) to generate them. It is a great alternative to traditional UI libraries, as it allows us to build modern user interfaces using simple, reusable components that are easy to customize and extend.

:::note[The cake is a lie]
The cake is a lie is a phrase that originated from the video game Portal, and it refers to the idea that something that seems too good to be true probably is. In the context of web development, it refers to the idea that building a web application is not as easy as it seems, and that there are many challenges and complexities involved in the process.

## Getting started

A great starting point to create a fullstack application with the mentioned requirements is the [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) template, which offers a cli tool to create a new Next.js application that allows us to pick the extra layers we want to include in our application. It is a great starting point for building fullstack applications using Next.js, tRPC, TanStack Query and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
pnpm create t3-app@latest my-t3-app
```

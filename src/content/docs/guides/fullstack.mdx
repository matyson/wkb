The web is a powerful platform for building applications. It allows us to create rich, interactive experiences that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
However, building a web application can be a complex task, and there are many different technologies and frameworks to choose from, specially nowadays with the rise of
so many JavaScript frameworks.

This guide intends to list our personal preferences and best practices when writing a web application. It is not a comprehensive guide to web development, but rather
a collection of tips and tricks that we have found useful in our own projects.

## Backend and Frontend: two runtimes, one app

When your web application is not only defined by the code running in the browser, but also by data and logic running on a server it can be defined as a "fullstack"
application. There are many different ways to build a fullstack application, but the most convenient way is to use a single language and technology stack for both the
backend and the frontend, as this allows us to communicate efficiently between the two runtimes and share code between them.

Since the web runs JavaScript in the browser, someone (Ryan Dahl) had the brilliant idea of running JavaScript on the server too, and thus Node.js was born.
This allowed us to build fullstack applications using a single language, JavaScript.

Considering that React is the most popular frontend framework, and that Node.js is the most popular backend runtime, it is no surprise that the most popular fullstack
framework is Next.js. It allows us to build fullstack applications using React and Node.js, and it has a great developer experience.
